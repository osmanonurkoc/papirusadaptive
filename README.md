# Adaptive Icon Packs

Hi guys I created several icon packs for adaptive icons supported launchers. You can access them here.


## What is the Adaptive Icons ?
Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduces adaptive launcher icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. For example, an adaptive launcher icon can display a circular shape on one OEM device, and display a squircle on another device. Each device OEM provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all adaptive icons with the same shape. Adaptive launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs, and the overview screen.

**Figure 1.**  Adaptive icons support a variety of masks which vary from one device to another.

You can control the look of your adaptive launcher icon by defining 2 layers, consisting of a background and a foreground. You must provide icon layers as drawables without masks or background shadows around the outline of the icon.


## Supported Launchers:

 - Rootless Pixel Launcher
 - Lawnchair Launcher (v2)
 - Hyperion Launcher
 - Lean Launcher
 - Nova Launcher
 
 ## **FAQs:**
**Q: Why it says Device Unsupported?**  
**A:** Adaptive icons are introduced in Android 8.0. So, The Icon Pack only works on Android 8.0+ Devices.  
  
**Q: Why it is not working on my device?**  
**A:** It mainly works on AOSP Android 8.0 Based Firmware (Lineage OS, Resurrection Remix, AEX etc.). It's not guaranteed that the icon pack will work on Devices with Custom Shell. It's not the problem of Icon Pack, It's the Problem of OEM. By the way, you can get refund.
